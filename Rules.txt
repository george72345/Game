Hello and welcome to the "Miners Treasure Hunt". My name is Bramblebrew Ironbeard and I am the shopkeeper and this is my mine! You are a prisoner here and the only way you can escape is through the locked door beside me. As you can see, the door is chained and reinforced so the only way through is to use the gemstone key. Where can you get this key? Well from me of course.... The key costs 10,000 coins and right now, you have none. Don't worry, you're in luck we are hiring. We need miners to harvest the precious minerals and ores here in "Oreopolis". You're more than welcome to stay here as a prisoner or you can get to work to buy your ticket to the surface. The choice is yours.
